Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Excitatory neuron model for Felix networks

Description
+++++++++++

``felix_exc`` low-pass filters incoming currents and emits a spike-like binary
output :math:`\phi(t)` on each time step as well as a low-pass trace of its own output
`\omega_E(t)` for use in synaptic plasticity [1]_. 

The membrane potential evolves according to 

.. math::

   \tau_{\text{m}} \frac{dV_\text{m}(t)}{dt} = -V_{\text{m}}(t) + k_1 \left(I_{\text{in}}(t) + k_2\eta(t)\right)

where the total input is given by

.. math::

   I_{\text{in}}(t) = I_{\text{syn,exc}}(t) + I_{\text{syn,inh}}(t) + I_{\text{syn,G}}(t) + I_E

with synaptic currents respectively from other excitatory neurons (via ``aes_synapse``), inhibitory neurons, 
and the area-global inhibitory neuron, all weighted with the corresponding synaptic weights, and a constant
input current :math:`I_E`. Furthemore, :math:`eta(t)` is a noise current with a value drawn at random uniformly 
from :math:`[-0.5, 0.5)` on each time step.

The output signal of the neuron is given by

.. math::

   \phi(t) = \begin{cases}
                  1 & \text{if}\quad V_m(t) > \theta + \alpha\omega(t) \\
                  0 & \text{otherwise}\;.
             \end{cases}

The adaptive threshold is governed by

.. math::

   \tau_{\text{Adapt}} \frac{\omega(t)}{dt} = -\omega(t) + \phi(t)

and for use by the ABS plasticity rule, the trace

   \tau_{\text{Favg}} \frac{\omega_E(t)}{dt} = -\omega_E(t) + \phi(t)

is computed.

.. note::

   This neuron, as well as ``felix_inh``, sends a spike on every time step. The spike-time offset :math:`O`
   sent with the spike contains the following information:

   * :math:`\phi=1` if :math:`O > 0`, otherwise `\phi=1`
   * :math:`\omega_E=|O|`

   This neuron receives input from other excitatory neurons via ``receptor_type`` 1 and 
   from inhibitory neurons via ``receptor_type`` 2.

.. note::

   NEST uses exact integration [2]_ to integrate subthreshold membrane
   dynamics with maximum precision.
