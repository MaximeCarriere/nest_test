Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Inhibitory neuron model for Felix networks

Description
+++++++++++

``felix_inh`` low-pass filters input received from ``felix_exc`` neurons
and returns its rectified membrane potential as stepwise continuous output [1]_.

In particular, the membrane potential evolves according to 

.. math::

   \tau_{\text{m}} \frac{dV_\text{m}(t)}{dt} = -V_{\text{m}}(t) + k_1 I_{\text{syn}}(t) 

where the synaptic input current :math:`I_{\text{syn}}(t)` is the total synaptic input
current at a given time step

.. math::

   I_{text{syn}}(t) = \sum_j w_j \phi_j(t - \Delta)

where the sum is over all presynaptic neurons (usually just one for Felix models),
:math:`w_j` the synaptic weight of the connection (usually :math:`w_j=1`), :math:`\phi_j`
the output function of the presynaptic neuron and :math:`\Delta` the delay, 
usually a single time step.

The output of the neuron is given by

.. math::

   \max(0, V_{\text{m}}) \;.

.. note::

   Input values :math:`\phi_j` are received as spike-time offset values and output
   values returned as spike-offset values by spikes emitted on every time step.

.. note::

   This model can also be used to implement the area-global inihibition, but then
   with a non-default time constant.

.. note::

   NEST uses exact integration [2]_ to integrate subthreshold membrane
   dynamics with maximum precision.


Parameters
